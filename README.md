This repository will feature a morse code translator.

I envision a class object that can do the following:
	1. read in morse code (space delimited) and give a message
	2. read in plain words and turn it into morse code.
	3. make my computer like a telegraph and say the morse code out loud
	4. ambitious: turn the space bar into a ...---... reader 
		(make a peep corresponding to length of tone and record it in dict)
